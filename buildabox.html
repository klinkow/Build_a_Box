    <p>The purpose of this website is you to teach <em>you</em> how to build the
      3-dimensional kind.  You will need a somewhat thick sheet of wood or other
      sturdy material and an ability to cut that material.  This site will ask you
      about the thickness of your material and how large you want the box. Then it
      will generate individualized instruction on how to build your box.  Enjoy!!!
