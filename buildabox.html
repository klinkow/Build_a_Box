    <p>The following are examples of different boxes.</p>

      <div class=horizontal>
        <img src="/home/jorge/Desktop/buildabox/img/1dbox.jpg" alt="1-d Box"/>
        <img src="/home/jorge/Desktop/buildabox/img/2dbox.png" alt="2-d Box"/>
        <img src="/home/jorge/Desktop/buildabox/img/3dbox.jpg" alt="3-d Box"/>
        <img src="/home/jorge/Desktop/buildabox/img/4dbox.gif" alt="4-d Box"/>

      </div>
    <p>1-dimensional box    2-dimensional box     3-dimensional box     4-dimensional box</p>

    <p>The purpose of this website is you to teach <em>you</em> how to build the
      3-dimensional kind.  You will need a sheet of somewhat thick wood and the
      ability to cut that wood. (Non-wood materials could be used too). This site will ask you
      about the thickness of your wood and how large you want the box. Then it
      will generate individualized instructions on how to build your box.  Enjoy!!!
